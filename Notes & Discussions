Problem Statement:

Design a Java program to automate the creation of student folders, course files,
and writing project names into those files based on predefined data arrays.
The program should read the arrays of student names, course names, and project names.
For each student, it should create a separate folder with the student's name and within that folder,
create a file named after the course they are enrolled in.
The program should then write the corresponding project name into the respective course file.

Requirements:
1. The program should use the provided arrays of student names, course names, and project names.
2. The base path for creating folders and files should be set to "./Folders/UserName/".
3. Each student folder should contain a single file named after the course they are enrolled in.
4. The program should handle any errors that may occur during folder and file creation,
   displaying appropriate error messages.
5. The program should successfully write the corresponding project name into each course file.
6. Ensure the program closes the file writer after writing data into the file.
7. After execution, the program should create the necessary folder structure and files with the
appropriate data.

Note: The program should be executed with the necessary permissions to create folders and files in the
specified directory.
